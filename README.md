# Personal Portfolio Website
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project was originally submitted as a CS50 Week 8 project, but I've decided to keep it and continue improving it as my personal web presence.

## TODOs
Here are some of the improvements and features I plan to add to this website:

1. **Data Visualization Page** - I will showcase various data visualization projects using R and my entries for R for Data Science #TidyTuesday . You can expect to find informative and visually appealing samples from my data visualization work.

2. **Individual Projects Page** - This page will feature my individual projects, each with:
    - A project thumbnail to give you a quick preview.
    - A detailed writeup describing the project, its goals, and the important computer science concepts used in the project.
    - Code snippets highlighting key sections of the project.
    - Links to the respective project repositories for further exploration.

3. **Contact API** - While I currently have a contact form in place, it is not yet linked and does not forward messages to my email. I will be working on implementing this functionality to enhance communication with visitors.
